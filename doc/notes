things we might want to do with a slack bot (catherinebot):

* send production/marketing schedule reminders (6 mos out, 2 wks out, etc)
    - it says, "respond with thumbsup to shut me up"
    - remind again every X hours until thumbsupped
    - once shut up, it says, "great, imma fuck off now" or "good, i was
      really hoping you were going to get to that"
    - send links to read-only template documents for appropriate msgs
* send reminders on StB, W&Aw/EM, staff meetings, etc.
    - email reminder for StB and W&A
    - 

separate process to deal with calendar events (robinbot):

* add relative events to calendar based on opening night date in cal
* create data source for slack bot reminders based on cal entries
* dates to add:
    - marketing/production dates from relative calendar
    - tech dates
    - performance dates
        - five weeks of thu/fri/sat
        - industry 2nd and 3rd
