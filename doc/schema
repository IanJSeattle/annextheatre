things i think robinbot will do:

* create calendar entries relative to opening night
* create a dateful data file for catherinebot

template fields we need:

* relative date (days/months before opening)
* title for calendar entry
* reminder text to post on slack
* channel to be notified
* how far ahead of event to notify
* how often to notify until marked complete
* create calendar date? Y/N
* create slack reminder? Y/N
